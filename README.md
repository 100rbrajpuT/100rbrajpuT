<!-- ### Hi This is Saurabh ðŸ‘‹

The field of technology is fascinating, as well as growing at a rapid speed. I witnessed my friends be a part of this field and enjoy their work, where they had something new to do everyday. Hence, I completed my B.Tech in computer science and engineering, and have been fascinated with the field of technology.

After completing my B.Tech, I realized that I wanted to up-scale my skills and learn more about the field of technology. After much research, I came across Masai school. I became interested in their courses and decided to join immediately.

Currently, I am learning to become a full stack web developer, with a specialization in MERN stack. However, after completing numerous projects at Masai school, I have gained expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Other than coding, I like reading, watching movies, and sketching.
